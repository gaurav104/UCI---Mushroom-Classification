# UCI---Mushroom-Classification

# Introduction
This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and  Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.

# Implementation
* Dropped columns depending on their distribution across different categories.
* Encoded categorical data.
* Implemented Support Vector Classifier with linear kernel using Scikit-Learn on Python to predict 
* K-fold cross validation score of 100%
